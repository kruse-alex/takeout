## R related Google Search History over time

![alt text](https://github.com/kruse-alex/takeout/blob/master/googlesearch.gif)

Find the code for the analysis here. You just need to go here https://takeout.google.com/settings/takeout and download your Google search history. 

Notes: The analysis takes only words into account that occured more than twenty times in my Google search history. And it only take connection between words into account that occured more than once. Without these filters there would be too much (uninteressting) data to plot.

Enjoy.
